<!-- Upcoming versions: Should have a more pleasant-looking menu for

	The design in general could use some slight updates,
	and the mobile design in particular could use further optimized
	font-sizes, line-heights and margins. I should also replace the
	font of the paragraphs. Furthermore, I'll be including photos and
	screenshots of some of my notes/sketches, mainly for aesthetic 
	reasons. -->

					<span class="highlight">Innovations drive the world forward</span>, and the IT industry is a great place to experience, envision and create real innovations. While I'm still a mere student, and will be until the summer of 2016, I strive to push the boundaries of technology, and am actively educating myself to reach a point where I can make a difference. <span class="highlight">I love learning new things</span>, I love working with awesome people who also have a bright vision of the future, and I love technology. I get a rush from seeing the latest innovations in internet of things, self-driving cars and big data, seeing the design of the latest smartwatch, trying the latest VR-demo, seeing screenshots of the next version of Windows, seeing the future video games, analysing the UX of products and learning new programming languages. Simply put: <span class="highlight">I have a passion for technological wonders</span>. Ten years from now, I see myself as a developer or consultant in the IT-industry, be it in Sweden or elsewhere.

					<span class="highlight">Latest message (2016-02-17)</span><br />I want to say a big thank you to all the people who have reached out to me and shown interest in myself and my future. I am currently on my last semester of my University studies, and am excited to truly start my career. Also, more projects should soon show up in my portfolio below. I'm taking some very intensive studies right now which occupies much of my time, but I am always looking for time to build new things.

				<h2 class="main-content-header indented">Skills</h2>
				<p class="indented">
					While this website is mainly dedicated to my portfolio, I'd like to briefly mention a few keywords in my skillset. I've always considered myself cunning both in <span class="highlight">writing</span> and <span class="highlight">speaking</span>, as the ability to formulate oneself correctly and also be able to communicate well with others are skills that I consider vital. I have years of experience with these skills, both from my studies and from my time working with marketing. Of course, I'm fluent in Swedish and English, and to ensure my proficiency in English, I've also taken additional courses in English at University level. I'm also currently talking University course in <span class="highlight">rhetoric</span>, to further increase my ability to write and speak. 
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					In terms of technical skills, I have experience with an array of programming languages: <span class="highlight">Java</span>, <span class="highlight">C#</span>, <span class="highlight">Ruby</span>, <span class="highlight">Javascript</span>, <span class="highlight">PHP</span>, <span class="highlight">Python</span>, <span class="highlight">Swift</span>, and of course <span class="highlight">SQL</span>. On top of this, I'm experienced with the style sheet language <span class="highlight">CSS</span> and multiple mark-up languages, including <span class="highlight">XML</span> and <span class="highlight">HTML</span>. The programming languages that I'm currently the most confident with are Java and C#. I've spent a lot of my spare time building native <span class="highlight">Android apps</span> in Java, and C# was the main programming language that we used at my University studies, and is one that I've also had use for when experimenting with the game engine <span class="highlight">Unity</span> and the cross-platform mobile IDE <span class="highlight">Xamarin</span>. I'm learning Swift and <span class="highlight">Objective-C</span> for <span class="highlight">iOS</span> development. Ruby was a programming language that I learned merely for fun, while Javascript and PHP were languages that I learned for web development at my University. Finally, I should also mention that I have a very good understanding of object-oriented principles. 
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					Furthermore, I'm experienced with <span class="highlight">Adobe Illustrator</span> and <span class="highlight">Adobe Photoshop</span>. <span class="highlight">User interface</span> and <span class="highlight">user experience</span> are extremely important to me, and it saddens me every time I see these aspects overlooked. The user should always be in focus, and understanding how to make software that is not only visually appealing, but also generates increased engagement, is the key to a successful product.

						<h2 class="main-content-header">Portfolio</h2>
						<p>
							I'm still a student, and I will be until at least summer of 2016, and as a student studying more than full-time and also working part-time, it can be hard to find the spare time to create projects, but I do my best. The projects listed here are projects that I've created in my spare time. I didn't want to include my school projects, because I don't see them as "my own". <span class="highlight">While most of these projects are Android apps built in Java, I want to stress that I've built applications in many IDE's and languages</span>, and that I don't want to give away the image that I am exclusively interested in Android development. I simply found mobile development to be fun, interesting and not too complicated for a rookie. It became a sandbox where I could experiment and get instant feedback. Like I mentioned above, I'm also learning iOS-development, and I am familiar with C# and its various uses. As for the web; I built my first website when I was ten years old. Of course, it had garbage HTML and in-line CSS, along with free-to-use copy/paste Javascript that truly made it look like a late 90's/early 00's website. Over the years however, I've not been focusing as much on web development. I've made a few websites using Javascript and PHP at my University, but they're not even remotely interesting enough to display. And for what it's worth, I built this very simple website from the ground up.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Jacob's Design Playground</h3>
					<p>
						This was one of the very first apps that I created. I made it during a summer while I was simultaneously learning Adobe Illustrator. <span class="highlight">This app is a collection of single-screen, functionless designs.</span> It was a way for me to fully understand how Android controllers work (activities, adapters, etc.), and also how XML works in Android and finally how vector graphics can be used to create assets for apps.
					</p>

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Encu</h3>
					<p>
						<span class="highlight">Encu is an app for encrypting pieces of text.</span> It uses a decently advanced formula of the Ceaser cipher, but of course, no matter how advanced it is, it's still a Caesar cipher. You can put a suit on a goat, but at the end of the day, it's still just a goat. I never intended to create any ground-breaking encryption algorithms with this app, it was just another practicing step for me. The app allows users to easily encrypt or decrypt pieces of text. Encrypted texts can be saved to the device. As this was an early project for me, adding internet features was out of scope, and thus users cannot send encrypted texts to each other. Rather, they can copy texts, and then send them via text, e-mail, or whatever they please. This can create a bad user experience, I acknowledge that, but this app was of course never intended to be released on Google Play. Oh, and you might be wondering why there are two keys rather than just one. From a technical standpoint, using the second optional key doesn't really make much of a difference, it was more an idea for the user to have the ability to use a secondary key that he or she may store in a separate way than they store the first key. Users also like to use numbers that mean something, and so this way, they can reduce the chance of anyone finding out their keys, by having two of them that must be used together.
					</p>
					<p>
						The design that I made for the app is quite unusual for an Android app, though I've grown fond of it myself. The idea for pixel-perfect rectangles came from looking at the Windows Phone operating system. The colour scheme for my app uses three tints of bluegrey, and every element has some level of transparency. It all creates an interesting look. Whitespace is kept to an absolute minimum in favour of boldness. Trust me, the interface feels better when you see it on an actual device. While looking at the screenshots below, one big oversight can be seen at the bottom of the third screen (not visible if you're viewing this website on a mobile; I know, I know). The button to the left says "cancel", while the button to the right says "back". In retrospect, it's unintuitive to have anything but "continue" on the right side, but my idea was that the large "continue" button above would be clear enough.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Natara</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first app that collected data from the internet, using JSON. <span class="highlight">There's not much too say about the app, it's just a simple and pointless weather app.</span> On the central tab, the user can get an overview of today's weather. To the right is an overview of the week, and to the left is an overview of the next 24 hours.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Other Various Android Projects</h3>
					<p>
						I've made many tech demos, such as one named Red Hawk, where I've been trying out transitions, animations and more. At the time of writing this, I started work on a notebook app just a short time ago. The idea is to have all notes in one place, with a simple-to-use interface, split into four tabs. The user can store regular notes, as well as hidden notes, and the user will have the option to set a password for these hidden notes. There will also be to-do and to-buy lists, where the user can very quickly add and remove items.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Early .NET Projects</h3>
					<p>
						As soon as I had finished my first course in C#, which was also my first course in programming altogether, I was excited to try to make some software all on my own. <span class="highlight">First, I made a practically non-graphical turn-based game called "The Cave"</span>. It took an insane amount of time, but I got it done and it's functional, even if it's not a very exciting game. <span class="highlight">I also made a talkbot; that is, a bot that can talk to you.</span> It also took an immense amount of time, and it works somewhat okay. I've been considering redoing the talkbot entirely as a phone app, using more advanced techniques, however it's a very time-consuming task, and a pretty pointless one at that, since every operating systems manufacturer has their own talkbot. Still, both of these projects were fun and presented many challenges that taught me a lot of things along the way.

				<p class="indented">
					The reason why I created this website was simply and purely to have a place where I could display my portfolio, as LinkedIn is very limited in that regard (read: useless); allowing neither formatting nor imagery, but I'd love to dedicate a paragraph or two on my studies. <span class="highlight">I am a student in information systems at Uppsala University</span>. I've learned a lot regarding systems development: the ideas behind it, the budgets, the diagrams and all the other components. I've taken additional courses in media- and communication, practical English, sustainable development, computer science and rhetoric, which have also taught me a great deal in their respective areas. You can find a full list of my University courses on my <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/jacobbergdahl/en" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a> (which is available in both English and Swedish). <span class="highlight">The list includes courses in object-oriented programming (in C#, Java, PHP and Javascript), databases, information security, multimedia, business and IT development, organisation and communication, media analysis, British and American culture and society, and more.</span> Also worth mentioning is that my previous employments include working with marketing for the union Jusek and with cashiering for the Swedish grocery store chain Coop.
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					Apart from my studies at universities and my own personal projects, <span class="highlight">I've also studied on online platforms</span>. On <span class="highlight">Udacity</span>, I've learned a lot about advanced Android concepts as well as how to use Git. <span class="highlight">Lynda</span> taught me how to use Adobe Illustrator, and <span class="highlight">Khan Academy</span> showed me the math behind Disney Pixar's movies. <span class="highlight">Codecadamy</span> taught me some web basics a long time ago, and <span class="highlight">Codeschool</span> explained certain dev tools to me in more detail. However, the platform where I've spent by far the most time is <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jacobbergdahl" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>, which I'm also moderating, which means I help new students, which is great fun! There, I've learned a range of subjects, in particular Android & iOS development, Ruby, Wordpress, design and much more. I intend to become one of the top 100 students in terms of achievements gained before mid-summer.
