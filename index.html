<!-- Known issue: Screenshots look off on Chrome. It might just be
	because of how Chrome displays downscaled images, or it might be
	a problem with my CSS. -->

<!-- Upcoming versions: Should have a more pleasant-looking menu for 
	mobile devices, rather than my quick hack. Might want to use 
	FlexBox too. The design in general could use some slight updates,
	and the mobile design in particular could use further optimized
	font-sizes, line-heights and margins. I should also replace the
	font of the paragraphs. Furthermore, I'll be including photos and
	screenshots of some of my notes/sketches, mainly for aesthetic 
	reasons. -->

				<h2 class="main-content-header indented">Skills</h2>
				<p class="indented">
					I've always considered myself a perfectionist both in <span class="highlight">writing</span> and <span class="highlight">speaking</span>, as the ability to formulate oneself correctly and also be able to communicate well with others are skills that I consider vital. I have years of experience with these skills, both from my studies and from my time working with marketing. Naturally, I'm fluent in Swedish and English, and to ensure my proficiency in English, I've also taken additional courses in English at University level.
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					In terms of technical skills, I have experience with an array of programming languages: <span class="highlight">Java</span>, <span class="highlight">C#</span>, <span class="highlight">Ruby</span>, <span class="highlight">Javascript</span>, <span class="highlight">PHP</span>, <span class="highlight">Python</span>, <span class="highlight">Swift</span>, and of course <span class="highlight">SQL</span>. On top of this, I'm experienced with the style sheet language <span class="highlight">CSS</span> and multiple mark-up languages, including <span class="highlight">XML</span> and <span class="highlight">HTML</span>. The programming languages that I'm currently the most confident with are Java and C#. I've spent a lot of my spare time building native <span class="highlight">Android apps</span> in Java, and C# was the main programming language that we used at my University studies, and is one that I've also had use for when experimenting with the game engine <span class="highlight">Unity</span> and the cross-platform mobile IDE <span class="highlight">Xamarin</span>. I'm learning Swift and <span class="highlight">Objective-C</span> for <span class="highlight">iOS</span> development. Ruby was a programming language that I learned merely for fun, while Javascript and PHP were languages that I learned for web development at my University. Finally, I have a very good understanding of object-oriented principles. 
				</p>
				<p class="indented">
					Furthermore, I'm well experienced with <span class="highlight">Adobe Illustrator</span> and <span class="highlight">Adobe Photoshop</span>. User interface and user experience are extremely important to me, and it saddens me every time I see these aspects overlooked. The user should always be in focus, and understanding how to make software that is not only visually appealing, but also generates increased engagement, is key to a successful product.

						<h2 class="main-content-header">Portfolio</h2>
						<p>
							I'm still a student, and I will be until at least summer of 2016, and as a student studying more than full-time and also working part-time, it can be hard to find the spare time to create projects, but I do my best. The projects listed here are projects that I've created in my spare time. I didn't want to include my school projects, because I can't see them as "my own". While most of these projects are Android apps built in Java, I want to stress that I've built applications in many IDE's and languages, and that I don't want to give away the image that I am exclusively interested in Android development. I simply found mobile development to be fun, interesting and not too complicated for a rookie. It became a sandbox where I could experiment and get instant feedback. Like I mentioned above, I'm also learning iOS-development, and I am familiar with C# and its various uses. As for the web; I built my first website when I was ten years old. Of course, it had garbage HTML and in-line CSS, along with free-to-use copy/paste Javascript that truly made it look like a late 90's/early 00's website. Over the years however, I've not been focusing as much on web development. I've made a few websites using Javascript and PHP at my University, but they're not even remotely interesting enough to display. And for what it's worth, I built this very simple website from the ground up.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Jacob's Design Playground</h3>
					<p>
						This was one of the very first apps that I created. I made it during a summer while I was simultaneously learning Adobe Illustrator, and thus this app is nothing but a collection of single-screen, functionless designs. This app was a way for me to fully understand how Android controllers work (activities, adapters, etc.), and also how XML works in Android and finally how vector graphics can be used to create assets for apps.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Encu</h3>
					<p>
						Encu is an app for encrypting pieces of text. It uses a decently advanced formula of the Ceaser cipher, but of course, no matter how advanced it is, it's still a Caesar cipher. You can put a suit on a goat, but it's still just a goat. I never intended to create any ground-breaking encryption algorithms with this app, it was just another practicing step for me. The app allows users to easily encrypt or decrypt pieces of text. Encrypted texts can be saved to the device. As this was an early project for me, adding internet features was out of scope, and thus users cannot send encrypted texts to each other. Rather, they can copy texts, and then send them via text, e-mail, or whatever they please. This can create a bad user experience, I acknowledge that, but this app was of course never intended to be released on Google Play. Oh, and you might be wondering why there are two keys rather than just one. From a technical standpoint, using the second optional key doesn't really make much of a difference, it was more an idea for the user to have the ability to use a secondary key that he or she may store in a separate way than they store the first key. Users also like to use numbers that mean something, and so this way, they can reduce the chance of anyone finding out their keys, by having two of them that must be used together.
					</p>
					<p>
						The design that I made for the app is quite unusual for an Android app, though I've grown fond of it myself. The idea for pixel-perfect rectangles came from looking at the Windows Phone operating system. The colour scheme for my app uses three tints of bluegrey, and every element has some level of transparency. It all creates an interesting look. Whitespace is kept to an absolute minimum in favour of boldness. Trust me, the interface feels better when you see it on an actual device. While looking at the screenshots below, one big oversight can be seen at the bottom of the third screen (not visible if you're viewing this website on a mobile; I know, I know). The button to the left says "cancel", while the button to the right says "back". In retrospect, it's unintuitive to have anything but "continue" on the right side, but my idea was that the large "continue" button above would be clear enough.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Natara</h3>
					<p>
						This was my first app that collected data from the internet, using JSON. There's not much to say about the app, it's just a simple and pointless weather app. On the central tab, the user can get an overview of today's weather. To the right is an overview of the week, and to the left is an overview of the next 24 hours.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Other Various Android Projects</h3>
					<p>
						I've made many tech demos, such as one named Red Hawk, where I've been trying out transitions, animations and more. At the time of writing this, I started work on a notebook app just a week ago. The idea is to have all notes in one place, with a simple-to-use interface, split into four tabs. The user can store regular notes, as well as hidden notes, and the user will have the option to set a password for these hidden notes. There will also be to-do and to-buy lists, where the user can very quickly add and remove items.

					<h3 class="main-content-subheader">Early .NET Projects</h3>
					<p>
						As soon as I had finished my first course in C#, which was also my first course in programming altogether, I was excited to try to make some software all on my own. First I made a practically non-graphical turn-based game called "The Cave". It took an insane amount of time, but I got it done and it's functional, even if it's not a very exciting game. I also made a talkbot; that is, a bot that can talk to you. It also took an immense amount of time, and it works somewhat okay. I've been considering redoing the talkbot entirely as a phone app, using more advanced techniques, however it's a very time-consuming task, and a pretty pointless one at that, since every operating systems manufacturer has their own talkbot. Still, both of these projects were fun and presented many challenges that taught me a lot of things along the way.

					The reason why I created this website was simply and purely to have a place where I could display my portfolio, as LinkedIn is very limited in that regard; allowing neither formatting nor imagery. If you're interested in seeing a full list of all my University courses, which includes courses such as object-oriented programming (in C#, Java, PHP and Javascript), databases, information security, media analysis, as well as non-technical courses such as British and American culture and society, please check out my <a href="https://se.linkedin.com/in/jacobbergdahl/en" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>, which is available in both Swedish and English. In short: I am studying information systems at Uppsala University (and I also took a course in Android development at University of Gavle). I've learned a lot regarding systems development: the ideas behind it, the budgets, the diagrams and all other components. Of course, I've also learned the principles of object-oriented programming there. I've taken additional courses in media- and communication, practical English and more, which have also taught me a great deal in their respective areas. My previous employments include working with marketing for the union Jusek and with cashiering for the Swedish grocery store chain Coop.

				<p class="indented">
					Apart from my studies at universities and my own personal projects, I've also studied on online platforms. On Udacity, I've learned a lot about advanced Android concepts and also how to use Git. Lynda taught me how to use Adobe Illustrator, and Khan Academy showed me the math behind Disney Pixar's movies. Codecadamy taught me some web basics a long time ago, and Codeschool explained certain dev tools to me in more detail. However, the platform where I've spent by far the most time is <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jacobbergdahl" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>, which I'm also moderating. There, I've learned a range of subjects, in particular Android & iOS development, Ruby, Wordpress, design and much more.
